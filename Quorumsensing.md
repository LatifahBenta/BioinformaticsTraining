### 1.What is Quorum Sensing? 
Ever wondered how one bacterium can communicate to another bacterium ðŸ¤” 

Quorum Sensing is Bacterial cell to cell communication process that involves the production , detection and response to extracellular signalling molecules called [autoinducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoinducer)

Quorum Sensing controls genes that direct activities that are beneficial when performed by groups of bacteria acting in synchrony. 

### 2.Stages of Quorum Sensing.

1.Production of small Biochemical signal molecules by the bacteria

2. Release of the signal molecules, **_either actively or passively_** , into the surrounding environment.

3. Recognition of the signal molecules by specific receptors once they exceed a threshold concentration.

4. Changes in gene regulation.

### 3. Quorum Sensing in Bacteria.
     ###Gram Negative Bacteria.

     The **lux-type** Quorum sensing system is the archetypal mechanism for species specific communication in gram-negative bacteria.

     It utilises the N-acylhomoserine Lactone (AHL) Molecules, which are small in size and lipophilioc in  nature hence freely diffusing across cell membranes.


     In general lux-type systems consists of two components, an autoinducer synthase(.e.g. **luxI**), which synthesizes AHLs from **S-adenosyl methionine** , and a transcriptional regulator e.g **LuxR**



We will take a look into the Gram negative Quorum Sensing sytems using ***Pseudomonas aerigunosa***as a prototype.

*P.aeruginosa* Virulence traits are controlled by two distinct lux-type Quorum Sensng systems termed as *las* and *rhl* named after their influence on elastase and rhamnolipid production,  respectively.

In this type of system the molecule that is being used is the N-acylhomoserine Lactone (AHL) which is small in size and lipophilic in nature.

Another Quorum sensing system that is independent of AHLs is the Quinolone signaling which makes use of Quinolone compounds termed 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolones (HAQs)


###Gram Positive Bacteria.
Quorum sensing in gram positive bacteria is based on the detection and production of Modified oligopeptides called Autoinducing Peptides (AIPs).

Here we will use *Staphylococcus aereus* which is encoded by the accessory gene regulator (*agr*)

Where as Quorum Sensing plays a role in Biofilm formation in *P.aerigunosa* , it does the opposite for *Staphylococcus aureus*
