### 1.What is Quorum Sensing? 
Ever wondered how one bacterium can communicate to another bacterium ðŸ¤”

Quorum Sensing is Bacterial cell to cell communication process that involves the production , detection and response to extracellular signalling molecules called [autoinducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoinducer)
