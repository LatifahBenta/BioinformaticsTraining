### 1.What is Quorum Sensing? 
Ever wondered how one bacterium can communicate to another bacterium ðŸ¤” 

Quorum Sensing is Bacterial cell to cell communication process that involves the production , detection and response to extracellular signalling molecules called [autoinducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoinducer)

Quorum Sensing controls genes that direct activities that are beneficial when performed by groups of bacteria acting in synchrony. 

### 2.Stages of Quorum Sensing.

1.Production of small Biochemical signal molecules by the bacteria

2. Release of the signal molecules, **_either actively or passively_** , into the surrounding environment.

3. Recognition of the signal molecules by specific receptors once they exceed a threshold concentration.

4. Changes in gene regulation.

### 3. Quorum Sensing in Bacteria.
     ### LuxIGram Negative Bacteria.

     The **lux-type** Quorum sensing system is the archetypal mechanism for species specific communication in gram-negative bacteria.

     It utilises the N-acylhomoserine Lactone (AHL) Molecules, which are small in size and lipophilioc in  nature hence freely diffusing across cell membranes.


     In general lux-type systems consists of two components, an autoinducer synthase(.e.g. **luxI**), which synthesizes AHLs from **S-adenosyl methionine** , and a transcriptional regulator e.g **LuxR**



We will take a look into the Gram negative Quorum Sensing sytems using ***Pseudomonas aerigunosa***as a prototype.

*P.aeruginosa* Virulence traits are controlled by two distinct lux-type Quorum Sensng systems termed as *las* and *rhl* named after their influence on elastase and rhamnolipid production,  respectively
