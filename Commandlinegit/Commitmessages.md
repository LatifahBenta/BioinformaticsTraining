# A Good git message

A good git message should contain 72 characters or less

The git message should be in the ***imperative***

### Other factors to consider when writing a commit message.

Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

Do not end the subject line with a period

Capitalize the subject line in each paragraph

### Information in the commit message

The information in the commit message should be short yet comprehensive.

In the commit message you should describe why the change is being made

Do not include patch-set specific comments
