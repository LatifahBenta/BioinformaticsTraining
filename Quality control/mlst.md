## MultiLocus Sequence Typing.

**MLST** is a technique in molecular biology for the typing of multiple loci, using DNA sequences of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping genes to characterize isolates of microbial species.

To download mlst I first created an environment using the command `conda create -n MLST` and activateed it using `Conda activate MLST`

I then used the command `conda -c bioconda mlst` to install the package within this environment.

 To run MLST we can use the command `mlst SRR23044205`
