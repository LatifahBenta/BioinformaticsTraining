Originally ***contigs*** were defined by Staden as a set of gel readings that are related to one another by overlap of their sequences.

A **Contig** is a set of overlapping DNA segments that together represent a Consensus region of DNA

***Consensus region of DNA*** is a calculated sequence of most frequent residues, either nucleotide or amino acids, found at each position in a sequence alignment.

In **Bottom-up** sequencing, a contig refers to overlapping sequence data.

The Bottom-up strategy consists of the following key steps:


- ***DNA Shearing***- Amplified Dna is randomly fragmented into appropriately sized pieces for sequencing.
-  ***DNA Assembly***- The subsequent sequence reads, data taht contain the sequences of the small fragments, are put into a database. The assembly software then searches the database for pairs of overlapping reads.
