## BOX PLOT

A ***Box plot*** is a method for graphically demonstratingthe locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile)

 A box plot can also be called a **Box and Whisker plot** this is because lines called **whiskers** extend from the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.

 ***Outliers*** that differ significaantly from the rest of the data may be plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers on the box plot.

 A box plot is [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) in nature that is, it is not restricted to assumptions concerning the nature of the population from which the sample is drawn.

 A box-plot is a standardised way of displaying data in the five-number summary: *the maximum*,*the minimum*,*the median*, *the first quartile* and *the last quartile*

The spacings in each subsection of the Box-plot indicatethe degree of spread and skewness of the data.

The box-plot allows one to visually estimate various [L-estimators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-estimator);notably the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range), [midhinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhinge), [midrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-range)

A Box-plot usually includes two parts: **A box** and a **A whisker** as shown below

A box is usually drawn from **Quartile1(Q1)** to **Quartile3(Q3)** with a horizontal line drawn in the middle to denote the **Median**


 The **Whiskers** must end at an observed end point but it can be defined in various ways.

 The boundary of the lower-whisker is the minimum value of the data-set, and the boundary of the upper whisker is the maximum value of the data-set.
